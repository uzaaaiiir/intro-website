The main icons we will be using are the company logo and icons representing social media like the instagram, facebook and twitter icons.
The other icons will be minimalist, but descriptive to the information they are introducing.

Typography

We are using Poppins from Google Fonts

Links
-----
In the navigation bar, the links are plain without user interaction, having animated underline/shadow on hover.
The other links depend on what their purpose and location are. Some have underlines all the time, others appear on hover

Buttons
-------
Buttons are given rounded corners, with first-letter capitalized in the text. The color applied to buttons are #08428C.
